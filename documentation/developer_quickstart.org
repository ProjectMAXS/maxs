If the [[*Prerequisistes][prerequisites]] are satisfied and everything is correctly
configured, MAXS can be obtained and build with two simple steps:

1. =git clone --recursive https://bitbucket.org/projectmaxs/maxs.git=
2. =cd maxs && make=

* Introduction

MAXS is developed under Linux and sometimes with Eclipse as IDE. This
guide hence focuses on this setup. But it should be also possible to
develop on other platforms, given the prerequisistes are satisfied.

* Prerequisites

In order develop MAXS, you need to be able to build it from
source. MAXS's build system requires the following prerequisites:

- [[https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html][Android SDK]]
- bash
- [[http://git-scm.com/][git]]
- make (e.g. [[http://www.gnu.org/software/make/][GNU Make]])
- A file system with symlink support and a POSIX compatible =ln= binary

* Checking out the source

#+begin_src
git clone --recursive https://bitbucket.org/projectmaxs/maxs.git
#+end_src

* Importing MAXS components projects into Eclipse

Call =make eclipse= from the project's root directory to setup the
Eclipse configuration. You can then import the components from Eclipse
with /File/ → /Import/ → /Android/ → /Existing Android Code Into
Workspace/, select the root directory of maxs and all component
projects should appear in the /Projects:/ list.
